    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Durum wheat flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Eggs (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 2 cups durum wheat flour to a mixing bowl, making a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Crack 3 large eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk them together, gradually incorporating the flour until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too dry, add a little bit of water.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into four equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Flatten one piece of dough with a rolling pin or use a pasta machine to roll it out into a thin sheet.</li>
        <li>Cut the sheet into desired pasta shape with a knife or pasta cutter.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining pieces of dough.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 2-3 minutes (depending on the thickness and shape of the pasta) until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta in a colander or strainer and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
      </ol>
