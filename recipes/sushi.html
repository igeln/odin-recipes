    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi is a popular Japanese dish that typically consists of seasoned sushi rice and a variety of fillings such as raw fish, vegetables, or cooked seafood. The rice is usually wrapped in a sheet of dried seaweed called nori and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Sushi can be served with wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger for added flavor. Sushi is known for its fresh and delicate flavors, and it has become a popular dish around the world.</p>

        <li>Rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Nori (dried seaweed)</li>
        <li>Sashimi-grade raw fish or cooked seafood</li>
        <li>Vegetables (e.g. cucumber, avocado, carrot)</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Rinse 2 cups of sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to a pot with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to low, then simmer for 18-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, mix 1/4 cup of rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and mix in the vinegar mixture until the rice is evenly coated. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut your desired fillings (e.g. raw fish, vegetables) into small strips or pieces.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori shiny-side down on a sushi mat or piece of plastic wrap. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge.</li>
        <li>Add your desired fillings in a row across the center of the rice.</li>
        <li>Roll up the sushi tightly using the mat or plastic wrap to help shape it. Use the border of rice at the top to seal the roll.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining nori sheets and fillings.</li>
        <li>Cut each roll into slices with a sharp knife and serve with wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger.</li>
      </ol>
